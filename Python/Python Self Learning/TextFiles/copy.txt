To all subjects of Ymir
 My name is Eren Yeager
 I'm using the power of the Founding Titan to address all of Ymir's subjects
 The hardening of all walls present on Paradis has come undone, and all titans entrapped within them have started marching
 My objective is to protect the people of Paradis, the place where I was born and raised
 However, the world wishes for the annihilation of the people of Paradis
 The hatred that has been swelling up for so long will certainly not end until not just the Paradisians, but all of Ymir's subject have been eliminated
 I reject that wish
 The wall titans shall trample all Earth outside of this island underfoot, until all life existing there has been exterminated from this world
